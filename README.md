# Gatsby Build/ Deploy + Netlify
-- Describe briefly (3-5 sentences), at a high-level, what this technology is used for or good add. --

I used my free time to explore different environments that we as developers can use to code more efficiently.
Gatsby allows developers of any background to deploy applications and work quickly with both gatsby and github. It utilizes Node.js and 
offers fairly straightforward installation guidelines. Pairing Gatsby and Netlify allows users to develop in a dynamic environment where once you launch your localhost, 
any changes you make will be updated right away on your localhost. The big bonus? Developer tools such as React are available from the beginning to access everything it has to offer.
I chose these tools to research as I found it will be beneficial to try and learn more ways to utilize React in the future.

 -- Does it replace or enhance a part of our Prime full-stack? --
 
The power of Gatsby and Netlify I believe will enhance our ability to view our work more frequently and removes smaller parts of the process with the quick reload times and not having to turn our servers on and off again.
I also think it opens up a few more doors in using various libraries and learning what can and cant be used across various dev tools.

--  What resources did you find most useful in learning? (Provide links & short descriptions) -- 
Gatsby Walkthrough: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/ Helps users create, push and deploy their starter blog!
Netlify Walkthrough: https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/#connecting-to-netlify 
^^ Helps users create, push, and launch Gatsby-made apps.
Support sections for both Gatsby and Netlify were also used, also not vary often and the details are still fairly vague.

-- What did you find most challenging? -- 
Gatsby deployment and app creation was very easy and hard to screw up.
HOWEVER, when trying to launch a site other than the one they show you how to create was causing lots of problems when reading the build scripts of other node projects.
I was able to launch both netlify and gatsby built locally but kept getting the same error over and over again when deploying onto netlify.
I also was unable to deploy after installing the new MacOS and can't find a whole lot of fixes yet so I might revert my OS tonight or tomorrow (Monday.)

-- What would you do/learn next with this technology if you had more time? -- 

I want to dive more into React when we learn it this coming week. I'm also really curious how we as devlopers can use multiple deployment style dev tools and how each one supports different languages...(and why some work better than others.)
Gatsby had a lot of info and Netlify alone had so many various ways to deploy apps and websites.

---------- USAGE GUIDE ----------

Description
When deployed, showcases the strong bond between building and developing work using Gatsby and Netlify dev tools.

Installation
Uses Node.JS, React(if desired)
Install the following: 
Homebrew: brew install
xcode-select --install (sets up cmd line)
node.js: brew install node
Install Git if you don't have it https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#mac-os-x
Since gatsby info is created already go ahead and run: gatsby build in the terminal and navigate to http://localhost:8000
